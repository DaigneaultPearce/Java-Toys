Initial solution
***determine how many men and women there are***
store first input.txt value as n

***create 2n + 1arrays for comparassions***
split each input.txt line as an array of integers

***create 1 array: matchArray***
look at matchArray[0] value. store as matchedValue.(array0 is matched with matchArray[0].value)
***determine which array0 position contains the value equal to matchArray[0].value***
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if(array0[i].value == matchedValue)
        matchedValuePos = i;
look at array0 position0.value. array0 prefers array0 position0.value
look at array[(n-1) + array0[position0.value]][0].value
if this value is == then we say array[0] prefers array0[0.value] and array[(n-1) + array0[position0.value]] prefers array[(n-1) + array0[position0.value]][0.value]

is this position greater than the position that holds the value of matchArray[0.value]?
